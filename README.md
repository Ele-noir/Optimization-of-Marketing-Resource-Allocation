# Optimization-of-Marketing-Resource-Allocation
 Welcome to (part of) my undergraduate thesis! It essentially discusses how to optimize the allocation of marketing resources in the fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG) industry with limited marketing resources.
 
  This study takes the "Herborist" brand under Shanghai Jahwa Group as a case to explore how FMCG companies can optimize their marketing investment strategies through customer value analysis in the context of digital marketing. The research employs three methods: **text mining, questionnaire survey, and fixed effects modeling**.

First, consumer review data from Herborist's self-operated flagship store on JD.com was crawled using Python, gathering over ten thousand comments. **Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) topic model** was applied to analyze these review texts, uncovering the main core drivers of customer value that consumers focus on, including product efficacy and brand. The results from the LDA text themes based on TF-IDF indicate that product value is a primary concern for consumers. This provides data support for the company to optimize its products and marketing strategies.

Secondly, a consumer survey was conducted to explore the driving factors of customer value in the skincare industry. The questionnaire covered aspects such as actual spending, future consumption budgets, and the importance of different value factors. **Regression analysis** revealed that consumers are most concerned with product efficacy (product value), followed by customer relationship value, while brand value received comparatively less attention.

Based on these findings, specific recommendations for optimizing marketing investment strategies for the "Herborist" brand were proposed. Firstly, adjust the marketing investment structure to increase spending on product innovation, brand promotion, and channel expansion. Secondly, leverage digital tools to more actively respond to the challenges of industry digital transformation, such as enhancing social media marketing and optimizing e-commerce channels.

In summary, this research provides an in-depth analysis of customer value management in FMCG companies within the digital marketing environment through various methods, offering both theoretical and practical significance for companies looking to optimize their marketing strategies and enhance market competitiveness. The innovative aspects of this study include: 

(1) applying the LDA topic model to analyze marketing investment strategies in the FMCG industry; 

(2) obtaining original big data from the Herborist flagship store on JD.com through web crawling; 

(3) constructing a regression model that influences consumption budgets based on customer value driving factors; 

and (4) proposing practical marketing investment optimization suggestions for the company. 

However, due to limitations in sample size and data, the conclusions of the study require further validation. Future research could expand the scope to explore customer value management strategies in more industries.
